#Algorithmic Number Sorter
There are fundamental sorting algorithms that all developers should learn. In this number sorter project, I used how to implement and visualize different sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort â€“ all with JavaScript.

This project helped me to understand the fundamental concepts behind these algorithms, and how to apply them to sort numerical data in web applications.
